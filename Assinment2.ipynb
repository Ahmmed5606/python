    "Syntax:\n",

    "Checking if an element exists in a list requires a linear search\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are therefore significantly faster for membership testing\n",

    ">>Set Operations:\n",
    "Sets support various mathematical set operations like union, intersection, and difference. These operations are not directly available for lists. \n",
