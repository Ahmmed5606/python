        "\n",
        "**NumPy** (short for **Numerical Python**) is a powerful open-source library in Python that provides support for **large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices**, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Core Features of NumPy**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **N-dimensional array object (`ndarray`)**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Central to NumPy is the `ndarray`, which allows fast and memory-efficient operations on numerical data.\n",
        "   * Unlike Python lists, NumPy arrays are of fixed size and hold elements of the same data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Broadcasting**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Enables arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without explicit looping.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Vectorization**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Eliminates the need for manual loops by applying operations over whole arrays, which is faster and more concise.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Mathematical operations**:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Built-in functions for linear algebra, Fourier transforms, statistics, random number generation, etc.\n",

        "2. **Views Instead of Copies:**\n",

        "   * NumPy slicing usually returns a **view** — a lightweight reference to the same memory block.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Low-Level Implementation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "   * NumPy is written in **C and Fortran**, giving it compiled-speed performance compared to Python's interpreted list operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Vectorization and Broadcasting:**\n",
        "\n",
