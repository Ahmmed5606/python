        "Ans:-\n",

        "\n",
        "* Each class has a clear responsibility, promoting separation of concerns.\n",

        "**Supports Multiple Inheritance:**\n",

        "Ans:-The __del__ method in Python is a special method known as a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is no longer in use and is being garbage collected).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Significance:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1) The __del__ method is used to define cleanup behavior for objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2) It is commonly used to release system resources, such as closing files or network connections, before the object is removed from memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) It allows you to customize what happens when an object is deleted, making the program more reliable in terms of resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "* It is defined using the syntax: def __del__(self):.\n",
        "\n",
        "* It is automatically invoked when the object is no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The exact time when __del__ is called is not predictable, because it depends on the garbage collection process.\n",
        "\n",

        "    def __del__(self):\n",

        "\n",
        "**Important's**\n",
        "* The exact time when __del__ is called is not guaranteed, because Python uses automatic garbage collection.\n",
